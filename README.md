This is **Landing Boilerplate** for smooth project start ðŸ™ƒ

It is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

It contains [Jump.js](https://github.com/callmecavs/jump.js) scrolling library, [Svgr](https://github.com/gregberge/svgr) tool to transform SVG into React components and react hook library [usehooks-ts](https://github.com/juliencrn/usehooks-ts)

This boilerplate uses grid system to create complex flexible layouts. Grid system is implemented with Grid and Col components.
